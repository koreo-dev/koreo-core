# Workflow

`Workflows` specify which Functions should be run, how their outputs map into
inputs, and manages their execution. In essence, they define a "controller".
That is, `Workflow` is a control-loop driven workflow orchestrator.

`Workflow` definitions are simple. They specify the resource type that will
cause the `Workflow` to run, provide configuration values to the entry-point,
perform a set of steps, and optionally surface conditions or state.

Think of a `Workflow` as a specification which is _instantiated_ with
configuration. Once instantiated, an instance of the `Workflow` will run
according to its configuration. Many instances of a `Workflow` may exist and
run concurrently. Many `Workflows` may be defined within one system, and
`Workflows` maybe be composed.

A `Workflow` is responsible for running _Logic_, which is a `ValueFunction`,
`ResourceFunction`, or another `Workflow`. _Logic_ should be thought of as
defining the body of a loop. The `Workflow` schedules iterations of that loop,
and manages the "external" (to that Logic's body) state interactions.

## Usage

The following sections elaborate on the key features of `Workflow` and their
intended uses.

### `spec.crdRef`: Running a Workflow

A `Workflow` may be _externally_ triggered to run, and have its _configuration_
provided by an object specified using `spec.crdRef`. This object serves to
provide the `Workflow`'s configuration and the `Workflow` instance may
optionally report its conditions and state within this object's `status` block.

We refer to the _instance_ of the `spec.crdRef` object which _triggers_ a
`Workflow` as its 'parent' or 'trigger'.


> ðŸš§ Warning
>
> Though it is possible, it is not advised to use a resource which is
> controlled by another controller. Instead create your own CRDs. Koreo
> Developer Tooling provides a tool to generate a CRD from a `Workflow`.

### `spec.configStep`: Defining the entry-point

This is a special step intended to define the entry-point for a `Workflow`.
`spec.configStep` shares most of the same options as other `spec.steps`.

The most important different is that the 'parent' will be provided to this step
as `inputs.parent`. This enables validation of configuration and provides the
ability to construct a well-structured, validated "config" that will be
available to other steps. It also helps to prevent accidental tight-coupling of
logic to a specific CRD. In practice we have found this to result in more
maintainable and reusable Functions.

The second difference is that this step is provided a default label: "config".
That means, unless changed, you may provide its return value as an input to
other steps by setting a key within their `inputs` to `=steps.config`.

Lastly, `spec.configStep` does not support `forEach` or `skipIf`.

The remaining options share the same behavior as `spec.steps` values.

### `spec.steps`: Defining the Logic

Each "step" defines some Logic to be called, specifies the inputs the Logic is
to be provided with, specifies an optional status condition, and optionally
specifies any state you wish exposed within the parent object's `status.state`.

Each step must specify either a `functionRef` or `workflowRef`. This defines
which Logic is to be called. It also specifies `inputs` to be provided to the
Logic. For Functions, the inputs are directly accessible within `inputs`. For
`Workflows`, the inputs are exposed under `inputs.parent`. That enables a
`Workflow` to be directly triggered via a `crdRef` _or_ it may be directly
called as a sub-workflow. That makes reuse and testing of `Workflows` easier.

A step may also specify a `forEach` block, which will cause the Logic to be
executed once per item in the `forEach.itemIn` list. Each item will be provided
within `inputs` with the key name specified in `forEach.inputKey`. This makes
using any Function within a `forEach` viable.

`skipIf` enables the `Workflow` to dynamically determine which steps to run.
This allows Logic to define a common interface, then for the `Workflow` to call
the correct Logic. This enables _if_ or _switch_ statement semantics.

A step may expose a Condition on the parent resource using `condition`. The
Condition's type will match `condition.type`, and this should be unique within
your `Workflow`. Note that uniqueness is intentionally not enforced so that you
may update / change conditions subsequently, but you should be cautious about
reusing the same type since it makes debugging much harder. `condition.name` is
used within the condition message sentence to make human-friendly status
messages. It should be a meaningful name or _short_ descriptive phrase.

> ðŸš§ Warning
>
> Be careful not to accidentally step on the `condition.type` value as it makes
> debugging much harder, and reduces visibility into a `Workflow`'s status.

The Logic's results may be exposed via the `state` key. The Koreo Expressions
within the `Workflow` step may access the Logic's return value within `value`.
If specified, `state` must be a mapping and it will be _merged_ with other
`step.sate` values. This allows for fine control over what and how state is
exposed.

> ðŸš§ Warning
>
> If multiple steps set the same state keys, the return values will be merged.
> This can lead to confusing values so be cautious.

## Example Workflow

The following `Workflow` demonstrates some of the capabilities.

```yaml
apiVersion: koreo.realkinetic.com/v1beta1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  name: simple-example.v1
  namespace: koreo-demo
spec:

  # Creation, modification, or deletion of a TriggerDummy will trigger
  # this Workflow to run. That is, this workflow will act as a _controller_ of
  # this resource type.
  crdRef:
    apiGroup: demo.koreo.realkinetic.com
    version: v1beta1
    kind: TriggerDummy

  # The 'parent' object's `metadata` and `spec`, will be passed to this
  # ValueFunction as `inputs.parent`, and the return value of this Function
  # will be available to other steps as `steps.config`.
  configStep:
    functionRef:
      kind: ValueFunction
      name: simple-example-config.v1

  # Steps may be run once all steps they reference have been run. To help make
  # the sequencing clearer, you are required to list steps after any step(s)
  # they reference. Note that steps may run concurrently as their dependencies
  # complete so you should not depend on the order in which they are listed.
  steps:
    # Each step must have a label, this label is an identifier. The return
    # value of the Logic (`functionRef` or `workflowRef`) is available to
    # be passed into other steps' inputs as `steps.simple_return_value`. If a
    # step does not return successfully, then any step referencing it will
    # automatically be skipped and marked as `depSkip`.
    - label: simple_return_value

      # The Logic to be run.
      functionRef:
        kind: ValueFunction
        name: simple-return-value.v1

      # The inputs are available within the Logic under `=inputs.`
      # `step.inputs` must be a mapping, but these may be Koreo Expressions,
      # simple values, lists, or objects. Use an expression to pass the return
      # value from another step.
      inputs:
        string: =steps.config.string
        int: =steps.config.int

      # Some or all of the return value may be surfaced into the parent's
      # `status.state`. This is useful to cache values or to surface them to
      # other tools such as a UI or CLI. By default, nothing is surfaced.
      state:
        config:
          nested_string: =value.nested.a_string
          empty_list: =value.empties.emptyList

    - label: resource_reader
      functionRef:
        kind: ResourceFunction
        name: resource-reader.v1

      # `step.inputs` may be a more complex structure, and Koreo Expressions
      # may be used for specific subkeys or nested within an object or list.
      inputs:
        name: resource-function-test
        validators:
          skip: false
          depSkip: false
          permFail: false
          retry: false
          ok: false
        values:
          string: =steps.config.string
          int: =steps.config.int

    - label: resource_factory
      functionRef:
        kind: ResourceFunction
        name: resource-factory.v1

      # Steps may be run once per item in an array. Each may be run
      # concurrently, so there is no execution ordering guarantee. The return
      # value of this step is an array of the return values who's order matches
      # source array's order. Each iterated value is provided to the Logic as
      # `=inputs[forEach.inputKey]`. That is, the value of input key is the
      # subkey withihn inputs.
      forEach:
        itemIn: =["a", "b", "c"]
        inputKey: suffix

      inputs:
        name: resource-function-test
        validators:
          skip: false
          depSkip: false
          permFail: false
```
